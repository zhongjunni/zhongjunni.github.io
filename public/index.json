This study presents an integrated solution utilizing edge computing, digital twins, and deep learning to enhance the understanding of climate in buildings. Parametric digital twins, created using an ontology, ensure consistent data representation across diverse service systems equipped by different buildings. Based on created digital twins and collected data, deep learning methods are employed to develop predictive models for identifying patterns in indoor climate and providing insights. Both the parametric digital twin and deep learning models are deployed on edge for low latency and privacy compliance. As a demonstration, a case study was conducted in a historic building in Östergötland, Sweden, to compare the performance of five deep learning architectures. The results indicate that the time-series dense encoder model exhibited strong competitiveness in performing multi-horizon forecasts of indoor temperature and relative humidity with low computational costs.","tags":[],"title":"Edge-based Parametric Digital Twins for Intelligent Building Indoor Climate Modeling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhongjun Ni","Chi Zhang","Magnus Karlsson","Shaofang Gong"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Many studies have demonstrated the potential of data-driven approaches in producing point forecasts of energy use. Despite this, little work has been undertaken to understand uncertainty in energy forecasts. However, many decision-making scenarios require information from a full conditional distribution of forecasts. This study has adapted and applied state-of-the-art deep learning architectures to address the problem of multi-horizon building energy forecasting. Eight different methods, including seven deep learning-based ones, were investigated to develop models to perform point and probabilistic forecasts. A comprehensive case study was conducted in two public historic buildings with different operating modes, namely the City Museum and the City Theatre, in Norrköping, Sweden. The performance of the developed models was evaluated, and the predictability of different scenarios of energy consumption was studied. The results show that incorporating future information on exogenous factors that determine energy use is critical for making accurate multi-horizon predictions. Furthermore, changes in the operating mode and activities held in a building bring more uncertainty in energy use and deteriorate the prediction accuracy of models. As assessed by the coefficient of variance of the root mean square error (CV-RMSE), the temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model exhibited strong competitiveness in performing point forecasts. The TFT model outperformed other models in predicting both types of energy use of the City Museum (CV-RMSE 29.7% for electricity consumption and CV-RMSE 8.7% for heating load) and heating load of the City Theatre (CV-RMSE 13.3%). In contrast to the dominance of the TFT model in point forecast, none of the models dominated the probabilistic forecast. The TFT, long short-term memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU) models made better probabilistic forecasts than others.","tags":[],"title":"A study of deep learning-based multi-horizon building energy forecasting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhongjun Ni","Chi Zhang","Magnus Karlsson","Shaofang Gong"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Previous studies have demonstrated the benefits of digitalization techniques in improving maintenance and managing threats to historic buildings. However, there still lacks a solution that can consistently organize data collected from historic buildings to reveal operating conditions of historic buildings in real-time and to facilitate various data analytics and simulations. This study aims to provide such a solution to help achieve preventive conservation. The proposed solution integrates Internet of Things and ontology to create digital twins of historic buildings. Internet of Things enables revealing the latest status of historic buildings, while ontology provides a consistent data schema for representing historic buildings. This study also gives a reference implementation by using public cloud services and open-source software libraries, which make it easier to be reused in other historic buildings. To verify the feasibility of the solution, we conducted a case study in the City Theatre, Norrköping, Sweden. The obtained results demonstrate the advantages of digital twins in providing maintenance knowledge and identifying potential risks caused by fluctuations of relative humidity.","tags":[],"title":"Enabling Preventive Conservation of Historic Buildings Through Cloud-based Digital Twins: A Case Study in the City Theatre, Norrköping","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhongjun Ni","Yu Liu","Magnus Karlsson","Shaofang Gong"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

However, most of the existing monitoring systems proposed for historic buildings are not for general digitization purposes that provide data for smart services employing, e.g., artificial intelligence with machine learning. In addition, considering that preserving historic buildings is a long-term process that demands preventive maintenance, a monitoring system requires stable and scalable storage and computing resources. In this paper, a digitalization framework is proposed for smart preservation of historic buildings. A sensing system following the architecture of this framework is implemented by integrating various advanced digitalization techniques, such as Internet of Things, Edge computing, and Cloud computing. The sensing system realizes remote data collection, enables viewing real-time and historical data, and provides the capability for performing real-time analysis to achieve preventive maintenance of historic buildings in future research. Field testing results show that the implemented sensing system has a 2% end-to-end loss rate for collecting data samples and the loss rate can be decreased to 0.3%. The low loss rate indicates that the proposed sensing system has high stability and meets the requirements for long-term monitoring of historic buildings.","tags":[],"title":"A Sensing System Based on Public Cloud to Monitor Indoor Environment of Historic Buildings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhongjun Ni","Petra Eriksson","Yu Liu","Magnus Karlsson","Shaofang Gong"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Heterogeneous data of historic buildings, such as indoor environment, energy consumption metering, and outdoor climate, are collected with proper sensors or retrieved from other data sources. Then, these data are periodically uploaded and stored in the database of the cloud platform. Based on these data, AI models are trained through appropriate machine learning algorithms to monitor historic buildings, predict energy consumption, and control energy-consuming equipment autonomously to reach the balance of energy efficiency, building conservation, and human comfort.
